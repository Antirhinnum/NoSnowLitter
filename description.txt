A simple mod that gives the player the option to disable enemies placing blocks (Snow Ballas, Antlions).
Also allows the player to disable the Sandgun from placing blocks and to disable Tombstones from being created.

Players can choose to make affected behaviours work as they do in vanilla (placing a block), drop the corresponding item, or simply vanish.
