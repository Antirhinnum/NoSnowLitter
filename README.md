# No Block Litter

![No Block Litter mod icon](icon.png)

**No Block Litter** is a tModLoader mod that stops NPCs from dropping blocks everywhere.

Currently, the following sources are blocked from creating blocks:
* Snow Ballas
* Antlions
* Sandgun
* Tombstones

All of these can be configured to follow vanilla's logic, to drop the corresponding item, or to simply vanish.
