No Block Litter is a mod that stops NPCs from dropping blocks everywhere.

Currently, the following sources are blocked from creating blocks:[list][*]Snow Ballas[*]Antlions[*]Sandgun[*]Tombstones[/list]

All of these can be configured to follow vanilla's logic, to drop the corresponding item, or to simply vanish.
